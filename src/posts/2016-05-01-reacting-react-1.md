I have not given to much attention to React as everyone else. I was in love with [Backbone][1] and [Marionette.js][2] at the time and _&#8220;My views are fine, thank you. I don&#8217;t need yet another view library!&#8221;_.

But in the end, I thought that it was a good time to begin looking at this &#8220;JavaScript library for building user interfaces&#8221;.

So these will be a series of posts, mainly for myself, for documenting my _reaction to the React hype_. I will post about resources, articles, and tutorials about React and its environment.

I like to start from the beginning when learning something. So I thought that [the official React site][3] would be a good first step.

Play around with the interactive home page, and then head to [the tutorial][4]. It should take one hour or two depending on how much you read the documentation. I suggest you to do so, as it will help you build a &#8220;glossary&#8221; (JSX? Component? props? state?)

After that, [Thinking in React][5] will give you a good approach to building things with React.

I think that this will be more than enough for the first day or two.

See you next  time!
