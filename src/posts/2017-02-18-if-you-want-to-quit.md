> I want to quit because I grew up poor, and I’m terrified that if I risk everything, I’ll die poor too.

> I want to quit because I stand a good chance of failing, every time I take on a client, every time I build a product or start a business or crack open a new dream, and I’ve failed enough times that I don’t want to feel the ground drop out from under me again.
