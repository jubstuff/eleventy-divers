Everyone should know how to get the most out of his working tool. To me, it&#8217;s the editor I use to code. That&#8217;s not the case for many of my fellow programmers, who know just the basic stuff.

That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve decided to realize these little tips. Here&#8217;s the first one, on how to automatically declare a class field.

I hope you enjoy the show.
