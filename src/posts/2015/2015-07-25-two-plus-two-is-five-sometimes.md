> An anthropologist was asking a primitive tribesman about arithmetic. When the anthropologist asked, &#8220;What does two and two make?&#8221; the tribesman replied, &#8220;Five.&#8221; Asked to explain, the tribesman said, &#8220;If I have a rope with two knots, and another rope with two knots, and I join the ropes together, then I have five knots.&#8221;
