  * #### [&#8220;Living under permanent surveillance and what that means for our freedom&#8221;][1]
    
    Ai Weiwei is one of the most important artists in the world. He contributed to Bird’s Nest stadium in Beijing. He&#8217;s living under permanent surveillance. Could our future be like his present?

  * #### [&#8220;What I Wish I Knew When I Started My Career as a Software Developer&#8221;][2]
    
    This is an answer to the Quora question [What do software developers age 30 and over know now that they wish they had known in their 20s?][3] by Michael O. Church. He shares his thoughts about his experiences in software development. A very good read for every software developer.

  * #### [&#8220;All this boils down to one simple thing. Professionals are willing to say “No”.&#8221;][4]

Uncle Bob is one of my models. I read just about everything he&#8217;s wrote. In this post he shares an important lesson. We are professionals, and we should know when to say &#8220;No&#8221;, even if it means to put our job on the line.

  * #### [&#8220;How to best build an engineering team&#8221;][5]
    
    What&#8217;s a CTO? And a Lead Architect? What about the VP Engineering? And what duties pertain to the Program Manager? Mark Suster shed a light on this topic.

  * #### [&#8220;Are you REALLY doing your best? Seriously, are you?&#8221;][6]

> So what exactly is my advice? Own the fuck up. You know good and well what you hate about yourself. You know good and well what makes the guilt-record taunt you when you can’t sleep at night. And you know good and well that your little nest of self-loathing has become a dangerously cozy comfort zone. 

  * #### [&#8220;The tradeoffs of (accidentally) discarding continuous integration&#8221;][7]
    
    This is my week&#8217;s favourite. Have you ever thought that, with feature branching, you are throwing away continuous integration? Maybe this advises don&#8217;t apply to small teams, but they are something to keep in mind. A great post by[Neal Ford][8]

  * #### [&#8220;From a UX perspective though, adding instructions on how to click a link is not optimal&#8221;][9]
    
    Did you know about the [`download` attribute in HTML5][10]? Me not, really. We can stop telling our users to _&#8220;right-click and save as&#8221;_

  * #### [&#8220;we invent cooking patterns – an abstraction on top of each ingredient / action pair&#8221;][11]
    
    I&#8217;m a disaster at cooking. But I liked this idea of transposing Design Patterns to cooking. I hope they will keep the pace and add as many patterns as possible.

  * #### [&#8220;seemingly normal programmers I ran into were sociopaths who had experienced the trauma of learning to code&#8221;][12]
    
    We&#8217;ve all been through it. If only someone could tell us what to do next&#8230; But life is hard. After the first steps in learning how to code, you are on your own, really. A nice analysis by [Erik Trautman][13].

  * #### [&#8220;Ask anyone and they’ll tell you that carousels are an anti-pattern. But maybe it’s not so&#8221;][14]

Are carousels really an anti-pattern? Personally I hate them. But on the mobile, they seems to work good. With data, you need to consider the context, all the time.
