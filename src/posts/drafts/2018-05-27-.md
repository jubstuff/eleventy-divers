This is something that drives my family crazy

Let me tell you a story: I was with a friend, having a beer and chatting. He was telling me about his holidays. Then my phone rang. He stopped, waiting for me to pick up the call. I muted the phone and asked him to continue. Then the phone rang again. He stopped again, but I just put silent mode and turned the phone upside down, with the screen facing the table.

Now picture this: a person that you don&#8217;t know is talking to me, you don&#8217;t know what about. You just walk in, interrupt the person talking, and ask me if I prefer milk chocolate or dark chocolate.
