After the installation of the update pack I got the annoying pc speaker beeping on login/logout.  
I was sure to have added the `blacklist pcspkr` line in <kbd>/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist</kbd> and so it was.

So I went for a Google search and found [this page in the Debian wiki][1] which had the instructions to disable a kernel module.

So to disable a the speaker kernel module I had to:

  1. Create the file <kbd>/etc/modprobe.d/pcspkr.conf</kbd> containing `blacklist pcspkr`
  2. Run `depmod -ae` as root 
  3. Run `update-initramfs -u` as root (not with sudo)

Now my ears can live again! ðŸ™‚
