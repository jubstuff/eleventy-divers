> We see a lot of feature-driven product design in which the cost of features is not properly accounted. Features can have a negative value to consumers because they make the products more difficult to understand and use.
> 
> We are finding that people like products that just work. It turns out that designs that just work are much harder to produce than designs that assemble long lists of features.
> 
> Features have a specification cost, a design cost, and a development cost. There is a testing cost and a reliability cost. The more features there are, the more likely one will develop problems or will interact badly with another.
