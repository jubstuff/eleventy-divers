This is one of the best books I&#8217;ve ever read.

Even if I&#8217;m not a designer by trade, I&#8217;ve been always curious about the processes behind it. And this book helped me understand a lot about how things are designed and how the design is dependent on the interaction with people using an object.

I liked the first and the last chapters the most: the first because it showed common examples of good and bad design, the latter because it explained how to apply all the concepts from the book in a real context.

Anyway, if you&#8217;re involved in product making at any level, you should definitely read this book, even if you skip some paragraphs in the middle chapters.
