It had to happen: I didn&#8217;t finish a book during my reading challenge.

It was [Thinking Strategically: The Competitive Edge in Business, Politics, and Everyday Life][1].

The first chapters were very good, but reading on it felt dry and I just couldn&#8217;t go on.

As I said, this will not count towards my goal of 53 books in one year.
