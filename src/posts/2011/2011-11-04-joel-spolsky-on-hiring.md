> Two of the biggest challenges in technical hiring are identifying people who are smart but don&#8217;t get things done and people who get things done but aren&#8217;t smart. A company in a competitive industry needs to avoid hiring both classes of people.
> 
> &#8220;People who are smart but don&#8217;t get things done often have PhDs and work in big companies where nobody listens to them because they are completely impractical,&#8221; explains Spolsky. 
> 
> &#8220;People who get things done but are not smart will do stupid things, seemingly without thinking about them, and somebody else will have to come clean up their mess later.&#8221;
