During the last two years, I did a lot of new things, trying to give back to the WordPress community: I volunteered at two WordCamps, [Vienna][1] and [Turin][2], where I was also [a speaker][3] and, lately, I co-organized [WordCamp Milano][4] (I will talk about it in a different post). Not talking about the [WordPress Meetup Milano][5] that I co-organize since March 2015.

It was fantastic.

But being so active is no easy task, and requires a lot of energy and attention, so you end up ignoring other aspects of your life.

For example, I realized that during the last two years, I didn&#8217;t focus very much on my learning path.

Being a [knowledge worker][6] means that learning should be a core part of your life. And books represent a central source of learning.

I didn&#8217;t read a lot of books in the last few years so here is my resolution: **I&#8217;ve decided to read (at least) 53 books in one year**. That&#8217;s just a little more than one book a week (for you math people it&#8217;s `1,01923076923077` books a week).

I know that it will be difficult and I don&#8217;t know if I can do this but how&#8217;s the saying:

> “Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you&#8217;ll land among the stars.” 

Here some FAQs:

### This seems like a new year&#8217;s resolution. Will you start in January?

No. The best moment to start a new activity is always _now_. So I started this challenge last week, 31/10/2016. And since then I already finished my first book: [Everybody Writes by Ann Handley][7] (that&#8217;s also one of the reasons why I&#8217;m writing this post).

### What books will you read?

Every book that I&#8217;ll find interesting! I started _(again)_ to track my activity on my [Goodreads account][8], if anyone is interested. I think I&#8217;ll start with entrepreneurship books, followed by crime stories and sci-fi. And, obviously, Computer Science!

### Will unfinished books count towards your goal?

No. If I realize I can&#8217;t finish the book, it will not count as read.

### 53 books? I read &#95;_insert ridiculously high number here_&#95; books per year!
