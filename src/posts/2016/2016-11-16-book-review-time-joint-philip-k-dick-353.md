[Time Out of Joint][1] by [Philip K. Dick][2]

My rating: [4 of 5 stars][3]

I finished this book in two days: that&#8217;s just how addicting it is.

The story is well written: maybe a little slow in the beginning and too fast near the end.

I liked very much the frequent shifts in the point of view.

_This book is number 3 out of 53 from my [personal books challenge][5]._
