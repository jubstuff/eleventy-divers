Wednesday I attended to my first meeting in Making WordPress Slack channel.

It was about HTTPS and there are two goals.

The first one is to look for a way to migrate from an HTTP site without human intervention. The other is about introducing a way to enable HTTPS during installation.

Technicalities apart, what struck me was the tone of the discussions.

There were a handful people talking about a difficult problem to tackle. Even if technical issues were discussed, the focus was on the users. How to make it simple for them to use this feature?

The next time you use an open source software and rejoice about a new feature, think about all the people involved in shipping that particular feature.

Many of them gave their time for free to build that particular thing.
