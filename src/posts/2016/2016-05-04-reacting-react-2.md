What to do after following the [official React tutorial][1]?

My suggestion is **RTFM! **([React docs][2])

It&#8217;s not sexy, it&#8217;s not appealing but it&#8217;s like medicine: you&#8217;ll not like it, but it will make you feel good.

I know what you&#8217;re thinking: _&#8220;I don&#8217;t need the manual. Show me some code, show me how to make a todo list and I&#8217;ll figure out the rest&#8221;. _

I&#8217;ve been there: what you&#8217;ll end up with is a collection of pieces and you&#8217;ll miss the big picture.

Try it the other way around: read all the documentation (it&#8217;s not that big) and then follow the tutorials. You don&#8217;t need to read it thoroughly: a fast read, **just to know the keywords**.

In this way, you&#8217;ll know that [`componentDidMount`][3] is not some custom-named method, but it&#8217;s part of the Component lifecycle.

Or you&#8217;ll understand the reason why there is an [`className`][4] attribute and not a `class` one.

In short: you&#8217;ll have something that will help you to connect the dots, and everything will be clearer.

Just take your time to read the documentation, it will be worth it.
