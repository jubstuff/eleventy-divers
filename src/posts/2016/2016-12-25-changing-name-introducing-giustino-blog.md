My last name has always been difficult to communicate to other people.

I&#8217;ve collected many variations during many years:

  * Barracchiello
  * Bordacchiello
  * Borriello
  * Barzachiello
  * Borzachielo

and so on.

You can understand that it was not so simple to have <http://borzacchiello.it> as my main website (and I&#8217;m not so good at spelling :D)

So here it is: [giustino.blog][1]!

PS

Merry Christmas!
