[Everybody Writes: Your Go-To Guide to Creating Ridiculously Good Content][1] by [Ann Handley][2]  
My rating: [4 of 5 stars][3]

Read this book if writing is not your job and you want a quick intro to the subject.

I read this book because I wanted to write more and learn about the fundamentals.

I realize that it&#8217;s a basic book, but I enjoyed it very much: the recipe-based format it&#8217;s really useful as you can go back and easily find what you need.

_This book is number 1 out of 53 from my [personal books challenge][5]._
