After [changing name][1], I also moved this website from a self managed VPS to [Siteground][2].

During the last months I was struggling to keep the VPS online due to lack of time, so I decided to use a real hosting ðŸ™‚

If you want [to give Siteground a try, use this link][3]: you get a discount on your hosting or a free site migration or up to 6 mo free hosting bonus and I get (up to) 3 months of free hosting. Sounds cool, right?
