As many of you know, English is not my main language.<sup id="fnref-1853-1"><a href="#fn-1853-1" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup>

There are a lot of apps for helping non-English writers but for my day to day writing I&#8217;m currently using four:

  * [Google Translate][1]: it may sound obvious, but I couldn&#8217;t live without this app.
  * [Grammarly][2]: I discovered it last year and I&#8217;ve used it daily since then. It activates on every textarea, highlighting every grammar and spelling mistake. The _double-click for synonim_ features is also really useful. With the premium version, it highlights even more advanced issues, like passive voice sentences.
  * [Hemingway App][3]: it&#8217;s an editor that helps you write readable content. In many ways, its features overlap with Grammarly, but for longer content I use both.
  * [Ludwig][4]: it defines itself as a _smart translator and linguistic search engine_ and it really is. The best thing about this app is that you can _search by examples_. You can enter an English sentence, and it will search for similar ones in its sources. A recent addition, but very valuable.
