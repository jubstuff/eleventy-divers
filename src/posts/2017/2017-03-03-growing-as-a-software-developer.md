Today was a tough day: one of those days when you&#8217;re trying to achieve your todo list items, but it just seems that the world is against you. Then I had an epiphany.

As many of you know, I&#8217;m a software developer. I always thought that my job was to produce lines of code, to design software systems, to review pull requests, and so on.

So I consider every day that I&#8217;m unable to write at least a line of code a wasted day.

_&#8220;So what is preventing you from doing your job?&#8221;_ I hear you asking.

**Interruptions**

_&#8220;Did you wrote this part of the system last year? Can you help me? I have to extend it&#8230;&#8221;_  
_&#8220;Can you help me with this git command?&#8221;_  
_&#8220;I just wanted your opinion&#8230;how would you solve this problem, given these constraints?&#8221;_

So, today, when I was sitting at my desk for the first time at 4 pm, 8 hours later I entered the office, I was furious to see Slack notifying me yet another &#8220;Can you help me with..&#8221; message.

But then, it happened.

I realized that, despite the fact that I haven&#8217;t produced a single line of code, **I enabled more than ten people to continue their work.**  
I helped all those stuck people to overcome a simple issue that was preventing them from keeping on working.

So, **instead of being bothered, I decided to be proud**. Instead of being shallow, I decided to give every person the time he needs to understand deeply what he&#8217;s asking me.

And I like to think that, as I&#8217;m growing as a person, my professional side is also changing, growing and adapting. Taking me to my next challenge.

So, the next time that someone asks you for help, think that they&#8217;re helping you grow.
