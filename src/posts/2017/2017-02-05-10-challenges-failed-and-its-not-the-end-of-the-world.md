I have to admit it: I&#8217;m not very consistent when it comes to personal challenges.

During the years I&#8217;ve challenged myself in various and often creative ways:

  1. [One hundred pushups][1]. **Failed** _(also, the sister project [Two hundred situps][2])_
  2. Playing piano 30 minutes a week. **Failed**
  3. Finishing [&#8220;Project Euler&#8221;][3].¬†**Failed**
  4. Doing at least one kata from [Codewars][4] a week. **Failed**
  5. Doing at least two lessons on [Duolingo][5]¬†(French) a day. **Failed**¬†_(I survived two months)_
  6. Track my daily activities on [I Done This][6].¬†**Failed**
  7. Publish a weekly screencast about PHPStorm. **Failed**¬†_([I managed to publish one][7])¬†_
  8. Write [morning][8] [pages][9] daily. **Failed** _(I wrote maybe ten, or twelve)_
  9. Wake up and go for a run three times a week. **Failed** ¬†_(I survived three months)_
 10. Submit a patch to WordPress Core weekly. **Failed** _(I did just three and, boy, were they trivial)_
 11. Blog more, at least once weekly. **Failed**.

These are just the first things that came to my mind: I can assure you that there are a lot more.

There was a time that, looking at all those **Failed**, I would&#8217;ve thought that I wasn&#8217;t good enough. _&#8220;You just need to push it more!&#8221;_

But, in retrospective:

  1. I can&#8217;t do one hundred pushups, but I can manage to survive to 25.
  2. I can&#8217;t play piano as when I was studying music, but I still can play a tune or two, when I&#8217;m with friends.
  3. During my day job I&#8217;ve used some principles that came from Project Euler problems.
  4. And Codewars too!
  5. I&#8217;m not fluent, but I can say _&#8220;Bonjour, je m&#8217;appelle Giustino.¬†√áa va?&#8221;¬†_and other basic sentences.
  6. Tracking my activities for a few days helped me understand where to put my efforts.
  7. [This mic][10] was a nice side effect of my screencast challenge.
  8. It was nice to handwrite a few pages (cramps included!).
  9. I understood that I don&#8217;t like running.
 10. Sorry WordPress Core people, I just don&#8217;t have excuses for this.

We can&#8217;t always follow our plans, Life just doesn&#8217;t align with those. But you have to keep going and try harder.

So, to celebrate all my failed past challenges, here are some new ones:

  * [Reading 53 books before October 31][11] _(I&#8217;m on book 6!)_
  * Blogging daily (I was heavily inspired from [Luca Sartoni][12]. Thanks, Luca üôÇ ) _(One month streak, and counting! )_
  * Exercise more, at least three times a week _(I exercised 10 days in the past two weeks)_

Will I fail these? I&#8217;m sure I will. But that&#8217;s the content for another post!
