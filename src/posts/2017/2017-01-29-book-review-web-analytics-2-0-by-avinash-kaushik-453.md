My rating: [5 of 5 stars][3]

I&#8217;ve always wanted to learn more about web analytics.  
But everything I read was either too simple or too advanced: this book was simply great because it explained the ideas behind the strategies, not only a step-by-step approach.

_This book is number 4 out of 53 from my [personal books challenge][5]._
